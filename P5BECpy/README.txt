INTRODUCTION
******************************************************************************
 
 The source code in this file contains only certain parts of the project that I personally worked on and felt could be best used to illustrate the way the system was meant to operate. As a result not all of the files that were intended to be used in the system can be found here. Some of the code for the custom portion of the payment system was used in conjunction with the examples given by Amazon Payments and Web Services.
